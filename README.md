⚠️ Problem Statement

Anganwadi centres play a crucial role in child welfare and nutrition, but they face several operational challenges:

1️⃣ Inaccurate Attendance Records

✅ Manual attendance tracking is prone to fraud and errors.
✅ Lack of proper authentication leads to misuse of resources.

2️⃣ Ration Distribution Issues

✅ Misreporting of the number of children present leads to overuse or underuse of ration.
✅ Inefficient tracking results in ration misallocation.

3️⃣ Lack of Proper Monitoring & Reporting

✅ Supervisors struggle with inefficient logging and reporting mechanisms.
✅ Delayed issue escalation affects timely decision-making.

🛠️ Our solution addresses these challenges by providing an intuitive and efficient web-based system.
