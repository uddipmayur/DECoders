Smart Digital Solution for Anganwadi Centre Management

Overview

This project is a scalable and user-centric web application designed to streamline the operations of Anganwadi centres, enhancing transparency and accountability. By integrating modern technologies such as facial recognition, real-time data synchronization, and supervisor reporting, this solution improves efficiency and reduces discrepancies in attendance and ration distribution.

Problem Statement

Anganwadi centres play a crucial role in child welfare and nutrition, but they face several operational challenges:

1. Inaccurate Attendance Records

Manual attendance tracking is prone to fraud and errors.

Lack of proper authentication leads to misuse of resources.



2. Ration Distribution Issues

Misreporting of the number of children present leads to overuse or underuse of ration.

Inefficient tracking results in ration misallocation.



3. Lack of Proper Monitoring & Reporting

Supervisors struggle with inefficient logging and reporting mechanisms.

Delayed issue escalation affects timely decision-making.




Our solution addresses these challenges by providing an intuitive and efficient web-based system.

Solution: Web-Based Application

We developed a feature-rich web application that improves operational efficiency in Anganwadi centres. The key components include:

1. Facial Recognition for Authentication

Integrated AI-powered facial recognition to authenticate the daily attendance of Anganwadi workers, helpers, and children.

Prevents fraudulent entries and ensures accurate record-keeping.

Works on mobile devices, making it easily accessible.


2. Ration Optimization

Tracks real-time attendance-based ration allocation.

Reduces ration discrepancies by verifying the actual number of children present.

Prevents ration misuse and ensures fair distribution.


3. Supervisor Reporting Module

Provides a dedicated dashboard for supervisors to:

Log their visits.

Submit reports.

Escalate issues directly to higher authorities.


Enables efficient monitoring and data-driven decision-making.


4. Offline Functionality

Designed to function without an active internet connection in remote areas.

Data is stored locally and synchronized in real-time when connectivity is available.


5. Security & User Experience

Prioritizes data security through encrypted storage and authentication mechanisms.

Developed with a user-friendly UI to ensure ease of use for Anganwadi workers and supervisors.
